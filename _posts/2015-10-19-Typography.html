<div class="section">
  <h1>BODY TEXT</h1>

  <p>This is a paragraph. It has margin-bottom by default.</p>

  <p>This is also a paragraph with additional text from <a href="http://www.rikeripsum.com/#!/" target='blank'>Riker Ipsum</a>. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Damage report! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this?</p>

  <span>Span paragraph with no margin-bottom. It is wrapped in a span tag rather than a p tag. It is an inline element which means it will butt up against other inline elements. <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/1khmmkg9/" target='blank'>Block vs Inline Example</a></span>
